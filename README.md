# Machine-Learning-Projects-Collection
This repository is a collection of machine learning projects Iâ€™ve developed to explore and apply key concepts in supervised and unsupervised learning. It includes hands-on implementations of both regression and classification models across various real-world datasets and use cases.
<b>
***Each project includes: *** 
<b>
Data preprocessing and feature engineering.  
<b>
Model selection and training.  
<b>
Evaluation and visualization of results.  
<b>
***Key project areas:***

Classification: spam detection, image classification, sentiment analysis, medical diagnosis.  

Regression: house price prediction, stock price forecasting, sales prediction.  

Other: clustering, recommendation systems, time series forecasting.  

***Tools & Libraries: *** 
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn etc.  

This repository serves as a personal learning archive and a resource for anyone interested in practical ML development. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
